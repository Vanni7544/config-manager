# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Config Manager.

This repository contains the **MIT-licensed Base edition** of Config Manager.
The Base edition is intentionally minimal and conservative by design.

## Contributions

Contributions are **not actively solicited**.

The project follows a strict design philosophy focused on:

- safety
- predictability
- explicit behavior
- reversibility

As a result:

- unsolicited feature additions may be declined
- changes that introduce implicit behavior or hidden side-effects
  will not be accepted

If you wish to propose a change, please ensure that it:

- is well scoped
- preserves existing behavior
- aligns with the documented design principles

## Issues

Bug reports are welcome **only if** they include:

- a clear description
- reproducible steps
- expected vs actual behavior

General feature requests and discussions are intentionally limited.

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability,
please refer to the `SECURITY.md` file.

and production safety workflows, see **Config Manager Pro**.
